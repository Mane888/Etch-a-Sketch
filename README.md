# Etch-a-Sketch
Etch-a-Sketch project 

This project is about creating a grid of square divs from a minimum 16x16 grid to a maximum of 100x100 in a container that is always 960x960px.

The divs are to be created using only JS and not in HTML.

After that, the divs should change their color to black when hover over them with the cursor, than add an option to make every div teke a random color when passing through them.

Also create an erasor, and a clear button that ressets the divs to white color.
